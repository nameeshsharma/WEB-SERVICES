My WebService Framework supports following annotations - Path, ClassType, ResponseType, RequestData and Forward.
Of which, Path is a class and method annotation, Forward and ResponseType is a method annotation, ClassType and RequestData are parameter annotations.
These all annotations can be applied on different classes and methods.
The Path annotation is used to locate the method based on the url.
The Forward Request is used to forward request to another page.
The ClassType annotation is used when the parameter of any method is non primitive.
The RequestData is used for the primitives and their Wrappers including String Class.
The ResponseData is used to know the return type of the method. For now, I have only defined 3 - Nothing, HTML and JSON.
